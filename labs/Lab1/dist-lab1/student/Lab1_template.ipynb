    "1. Look at the big picture.\n",
    "2. Get the data.\n",
    "3. Explore and visualize the data to gain insights.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "In this lab, we will introduce the basics of machine learning in **Python** by focusing on **regression**, a core technique used to predict continuous outcomes. We will use the popular **scikit-learn** library, which provides easy-to-use tools for building and evaluating machine learning models.\n",
    "Specifically, we will focus on how regression algorithms can help us model and predict abalone data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand the concept of regression and its implementation in Pythnon\n",
    "- Implement simple and multiple linear regression models\n",
    "- Evaluate model performance using various metrics like **R²**, **MSE**, and **RMSE**\n",
    "- Visualize regression prediction results \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Machine Learning**: A subset of artificial intelligence where algorithms learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "- **Regression**: A machine learning method for predicting continuous values.\n",
    "  - **Simple Linear Regression**: A regression model with one independent variable.\n",
    "  - **Multiple Linear Regression**: A regression model with two or more independent variables.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Scikit-learn**: A Python library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and machine learning. We will use it for:\n",
    "  - **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing data for the model.\n",
    "  - **Model Training**: Fitting the regression model to our data.\n",
    "  - **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using model evaluation metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Tools to assess how well our model fits the data, such as:\n",
    "  - **R² (R-squared)**: Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).\n",
    "  - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: The average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "  - **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: The square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
