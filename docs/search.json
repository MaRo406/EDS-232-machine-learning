    "text": "Course Description\nMachine learning is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that “learn,” that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. In this course, we focus on the core concepts of machine learning that beginning ML researchers must know. We cover “classical machine learning” primarily using R and explore applications to environmental science. To understand broader concepts of artificial intelligence or deep learning, a strong fundamental knowledge of machine learning is indispensable."

By the end of the course, students should be able to:\n\nBuild machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning packages.\nBuild and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear and logistic regression.\nApply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.\nBuild and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.\nUse unsupervised learning techniques including clustering."
