In this course, we focus on the core concepts of machine learning that beginning ML researchers must know. We cover ‘classical machine learning’ primarily using R, and explore applications to environmental science. To understand broader concepts of artificial intelligence or deep learning, a strong fundamental knowledge of machine learning is indispensable.\r\nTeaching team\r\nInstructor: Mateo Robbins (mjrobbins@ucsb.edu)\r\nStudent hours: Thursday 10:45-11:45pm (Location: Bren 1424)\r\nTeaching assistant: Allie Caughman (acaughman@bren.ucsb.edu)\r\nStudent hours: Tuesday 3:00-4:00pm (Location: Bren 3526)\r\nImportant links\r\nLink to full course syllabus\r\nWeekly course schedule\r\nLecture: TTh 9:30am - 10:45am PST (Bren 1424)\r\nSection:\r\nFirst 5 weeks: Th 2:00pm - 2:50pm, 3:00 - 3:50pm\r\n2/15 and onward: Th 12:30 - 1:20pm, 1:30 - 2:20pm\r\n\r\nLearning objectives\r\nThe goal of EDS 232 is to equip students with a strong foundation in the core concepts of machine learning. By the end of the course, students should be able to: \r\nBuild machine learning models in R using popular machine learning packages\r\nBuild and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear and logistic regression.\r\nApply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.\r\nBuild and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.\r\nUse unsupervised learning techniques including clustering.\r\nCourse requirements\r\nComputing\r\nMinimum MEDS device requirements\r\nR version 4.0.2 (or higher)\r\nRStudio version 1.4.1103 (or higher)\r\nTextbook\r\nHands-On Machine Learning with R, by Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell\r\n\r\nTentative topics\r\nWeek #\r\nDates\r\nLecture \r\nLab\r\n1\r\n1/9, 1/11\r\nIntroduction, Linear Regression and ML Modeling Fundamentals I\r\n1.Regression I (Pumpkins)\r\n2\r\n1/16, 1/18\r\nRegularized Regression and ML Modeling Fundamentals II\r\n2.Regression II (Pumpkins)\r\n3\r\n1/23, 1/25\r\nLogistic Regression, Classification\r\n3.Regularized Regression (Abalone)\r\n4\r\n1/30, 2/1\r\nK-nearest neighbors, Decision Trees\r\n4.Classification (Wildfire)\r\n5\r\n2/6, 2/8\r\nEthics and Bias in ML\r\n5.Classification (Spotify)\r\n6\r\n2/13, 2/15\r\nBagging, Random Forest\r\n5.Classification (Spotify)\r\n7\r\n2/20, 2/22\r\nGradient Boosting\r\n6.Boosting\r\n8\r\n2/27, 3/1\r\nClustering\r\n7.Clustering\r\n9\r\n3/6, 3/8\r\nTBD\r\nTBD\r\n10\r\n3/13, 3/15\r\nTBD\r\nKaggle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
